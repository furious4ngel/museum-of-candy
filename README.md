# Museum of Candy
This is my second project submission for the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. It is a Bootstrap website for a
fictitious Instagram museum.

## Take 1
My page looks very similar to Colt's, aside from minor differences.
I see the appeal of Bootstrap (components and utility classes). However, I felt like I had little control over the styling because Bootstrap provided them for me, which is, of course, what a CSS framework does. That being said, I don't dislike Bootstrap and will try to use it in future projects.
